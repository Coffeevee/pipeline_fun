# Personal Library
A pipeline for taking a `.csv` file containing books from a personal library and manipulating it.

All files for this data pipeline follow the naming convention of `personal_library_book...` or define a directory with that name.

Future Implementation Ideas:
- Post this CSV to a database (possibly Postgres)
