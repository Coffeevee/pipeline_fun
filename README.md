Personal Project - Data Pipeline Sandbox

## Introduction
This is a personal sandbox for playing around with different data pipelines, Airflow orchestration, and data validation leveraging Airflow and Python libraries primarily.

In this project, I will also attempt to build a good documentation strategy for pipeline management, since I believe that is directly correlated with data engineering success on projects.

## Pipeline Table of Contents
### Personal Library (Book) CSV Reader
Objective: Reads a defined CSV containing columns relevant to books in a personal library, validates some formatting, corrects formatting issues, and returns a corrected CSV.

Future Implementation Ideas:
- Post this CSV to a database (possibly Postgres)
