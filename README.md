## Introduction
This is a personal sandbox for playing around with different data pipelines, Airflow orchestration, and data validation leveraging Airflow and Python libraries primarily.

In this project, I will also attempt to build a good documentation strategy for pipeline management, since I believe that is directly correlated with data engineering success on projects.
